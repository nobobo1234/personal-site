# Noah van Boven - Personal Website

This is the repository with the source code of my personal website.
I used react for building this website. For locally building and running
my app you can use yarn or npm.

## Building
1. Clone my repository using the download button or `git clone`.
2. Install all the necessary packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. For locally running my site use: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
For building my site use `npm run build` or `yarn run build`.
